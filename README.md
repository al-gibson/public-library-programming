Repository on public library programming data in Washington State

This dataset is specifically for a capstone project at the University of Washington MLIS program.  Two students are gathering qualitative information from 20 librarians across 13 library districts in Washington state.  They are interviewing librarians regarding programming offered and how it was impacted by the pandemic.  One of the students, Anna Gibson, thought it would be useful to curate programming data from pre-pandemic years and then compare to data released for 2020 to compare how programming has changed.  But gathering data on the only the 13 library districts was not available.  So, she curated a dataset of programming information from the Washington State Library for only the 13 library districts that her research needed.  2018 and 2019 data for programming is located at this Github repository and 2020 data will be uploaded once its released from the Washington State Library.  

If you’d like to look at all library district programming information in Washington State, it can be found below.  It’s in .pdf format but Anna used the program Tabula to pull out the library district information she needed.  You can do the same if you are only interested in certain library district data.

2018:  https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/library/libraries/libdev/downloads/statistics/18stats/programs.pdf 

Anna will update this repository as new data becomes available.  Please reach out to her for any questions – annag18@uw.edu.
